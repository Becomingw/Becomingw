Becomingw, from China, an ordinary graduate student majoring in medicine. 

ðŸ‘€ I am passionate about all sorts of unusual things and try to experience life. 

ðŸŒ± I want to learn everything and know everything, but there is nothing particularly special about me. 

ðŸ˜‚ Every day, I am either slacking off or on my way to slacking off.
